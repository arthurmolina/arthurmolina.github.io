Little by little I am migrating and translating all my texts from old blogs and articles spread across the internet to my old new corner. Many texts are not worth transplanting, others lose their meaning when translated. But with baby steps I will do this work and try to maintain at least their chronology. I hope it's worth reading. Thanks new/old/ghost reader for stopping by.
